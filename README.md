Everytime when I'm trying to get some sweet science points, I need to keep in mind to take the scientist Bob with me. Now, he ist just a click away. Whenever I forget about him, this mod tells me about it. And Bob loves the attention he gets!

##What this mod can do:
* Adds a little button in the editor
* When active (green) this mod tells you on the launchpad if you have a scientist with you
* When inactive (red) this mod doesn't do anything

##What this mod can't do:
* Throw Bob into the vessel automatically (100/100 tests show: Bob doesn't like to be thrown)
* Keep a look at engineers or pilots (maybe something for the future)

##How to install:
1. Download the .zip file from [here](http://mods.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/247780-bobtracker)
2. Unpack the .zip file
3. Copy the BobTracker/ folder to your /KSP/installation/GameData/
